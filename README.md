# **Programming for Data Analysis 2021 - Assignment**

## Repository Content:
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook outlining the use and functionalities of the numpy.random package in Python.

## How to run the Jupyter notebook:
To be able to run the Notebook, Python needs to be installed. 

Note that the code in this notebook uses some content which might not be compatible with NumPy versions older than 1.17. The notebook contains a check which allows the user to verify the installed version of NumPy (see section 1.1).

1. Download and install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html)
2. Access the command line interface (for example [Cmder](https://cmder.net/)] or using the  Windows Command Prompt)
3. Run 'jupyter lab'

## Note on Sample Size Limitations:
For demonstration purposes and to minimise memory usage, most of the code uses rather small sample sizes. As a result, outputs of cells might appear to not have produced the correct random output, for example, the permutations functions (see section 2.2) might return the same values as for the original array. It can therefore be necessary to re-run cells to achieve the intended result.
